The film's story is about a carefree young non-believer of supreme power, Baba, who is a reincarnation of a great saint from the Himalayas. After several twists and problems caused by corrupt local politicians, Baba is taken to Mahavatar Babaji, whom Baba was a follower of in his last life. Baba gets tested by the deity to overcome several illusions of the materialistic world and is given seven chances of wishes. How he uses the wishes while developing spirituality and falling into loggerheads with the villains at the same time forms the rest of the story[^4^].
 
First released in 2002, the film met with mixed critical reviews and was a box-office failure, resulting in Rajinikanth reimbursing distributors for their losses. But over the years, the film gained cult following, as a result of which the film was digitally remastered, re-edited with a shorter duration and an alternate ending, and re-released by Lyca Productions on 10 December 2022, twenty years after its original release, coinciding with Rajinikanth's birthday weekend. The re-released film was declared a commercial success in the box office[^6^].
 
Baba is also available in Telugu language, dubbed from the original Tamil version. However, finding a legal copy of the film online can be challenging, as some websites may offer pirated or low-quality versions of the film. One such example is "Rajinikanth Baba Movie In Telugu Torrent.rar", which is a file name that suggests an illegal download of the film using torrent software. Torrent files are often used to share large files over peer-to-peer networks, but they can also pose risks such as malware infection, copyright infringement, or legal action[^7^]. Therefore, it is advisable to avoid such websites and sources and watch the film on legitimate platforms.
